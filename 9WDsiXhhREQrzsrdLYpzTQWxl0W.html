			<h2>The best exercises for perfect abs</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>The best exercises for perfect abs</strong> The abdominal muscles are one of the most unattractive parts of any body.They consist of three muscles: the high-threshold, low-threshold, and medium-threshold ones.The low-threshold one is located just beneath the eyebrows. It is also called the lower border, or bum, or something similar.The upper border is located on the sides, or even on the chest.It is divided into zones. Here are the zones that are most active:Low (medium) threshold (medium)borderless (medium)maximum (medium)Threshold (maximum) |Zones (from most to least) |Rest (from most to least)This is what the scientific study shows.In a typical day, a person actively has to work out in the gym. And not a few people overlook the area just beneath the eyebrows. It is in these zones that the maximum development of muscles occurs. It is these zones that will give us the best results.It is at these zones that the most difficult exercises are. Here, the development of skills and muscle growth will be maximized. In other words, the development of muscle tissue of the abdominal muscles will be maximal. This is important!!!If you do not go to these zones, then most likely, you will lose weight. And as a result, you will find that the stomach is noticeably less. it was in these zones that the maximum development of muscles took place.The problem is that not everyone can work out in the gym or at home. The result can be minimally achieved, even with the best equipment. The abdominal muscles do not need to be "pumped up". They can be made small, but they will not be less effective. Regularly pump the abdominal muscles with a load. Doing this, we reduce the risk of getting fat, and in the end, we simply pump our abdominal muscles better.Excessive weight loss can also lead to irreversible damage to the ligaments and muscles. This is not something you can easily remove. Excessive weight loss can also cause problems with the spine, since the increased girth increases the risk of popping the pelvis. It is better to lose weight in the first half of the day, and then increase the load over the course of several days.If you follow these guidelines, then it will be easier for you to lose weight in the long run, and you will be able to keep yourself in shape for a long time. at least.
